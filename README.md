    <h4> Introduction</h4>
    <p> The idea of the project is to explore the applicability of blockchain technology in the
domain of social networking by providing a simple yet useable proof of concept (POC).
This application allows various individuals to engage in
productive dialogues without the necessity of knowing each other utilizing the benefits
of blockchain. In a productive dialogue, various users will provide their opinion in
regard to a subject matter under discussion. In Block Smithereens any user can initiate a dialogue, by
posting a subject matter to be discussed, while any interested user can engage in a
dialogue by providing his own opinion on the discussed matter. In terms of traditional
social media platforms these actions correspond to “creating a post” and “adding
comments” on a given post.
BSN decentralized and is not controlled by any centralized entities. Even
though any-user can initiate or comment on a dialogue, there are no
centralized entities that can decide what is a valid post or comment, and
what is spam or irrelevant. The system users themselves will be responsible
for that aspect, which we call: regulating the network. By regulating a post,
a user will rate its effectiveness by providing a number from 1-10; in other
words, is this subject valid for discussion or not; with 1 being the least and
10 being the most. For regulating a comment, a user needs to review it
and provide his degree of acceptance. Reviewing a post is the degree of acceptance is a
number from 1-10, that represents the user's acceptance to what he read,
with 1 being “I don‟t agree” and 10 being “I completely agree”.
